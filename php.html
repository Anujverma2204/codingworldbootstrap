              <h2 style="color: white;">Pyhton History</h2>
              <p style="color: white;">PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995.The PHP reference implementation is now produced by the PHP Group. PHP was originally an abbreviation of Personal Home Page,but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.PHP development began in 1993 when Rasmus Lerdorf wrote several Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs in C,which he used to maintain his personal homepage. He extended them to work with web forms and to communicate with databases, and called this implementation "Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter" or PHP/FI.</p>

                <h1 style="color: white;">Why PHP..?</h1>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    PHP programming can be used to create most things that a software developer needs. However, there are three main areas in which it thrives.

                    Server-side scripting
                    Server-side Script is PHP’s main strength. If you are just learning to code and want to explore server-side scripting, PHP is a great language to learn. To get cracking with PHP server-side scripting you’ll need to have a PHP parser, web server and web browser.
                    Command-line scripting 
                    Command-line scripting is ideal for scripts made using cron (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows). It is also great for simple text processing.
                    Writing desktop applications
                    PHP is probably not the best language to use to create desktop applications but for the advanced web developer, it provides you with many more options than its competitors.
                    Of course, PHP can do many other things. For example, it is excellent at collecting form data, encrypting user data and sending and receiving cookies. One of the major features of PHP that makes it so usable is that it is compatible with all major operating systems so you can code no matter what tech you are using.</p>

                    <h1 style="color: white;">How to Use PHP?</h1>
                    <p style="color: white;">
                        There are three major things needed to code effectively in PHP: <br>

                        (1) PHP Parser: The parser takes PHP code and analyses it, outputting a respective syntax tree that puts the source into an easier to read format for machines to understand <br>
                        (2) Web Server: The server is the program that will execute your PHP files to form webpages <br>
                        (3) Web Browser: The browser will allow you to view the PHP page through the server, in the same way as with any other content on the web</p>

                        <h1 style="color: white;">Advantages of PHP</h1>
                        <p style="color: white;">
                            PHP has some advantages that have made it so popular, and it's been the go-to language for web servers for more than 15 years now. Here are some of PHP's benefits:

                            Cross-Platform: PHP is platform-independent. You don't have to have a particular OS to use it because it runs on every platform, whether it's Mac, Windows, or Linux.
                            
                            Open Source: PHP is open source. The original code is made available to everyone who wants to build upon it. This is one of the reasons why one of its frameworks, Laravel, is so popular.
                            
                            Easy to learn: PHP is not hard to learn for absolute beginners. You can pick it up pretty if you already have programming knowledge.
                            
                            PHP syncs with all Databases: You can easily connect PHP to all Databases, relational and non-relational. So it can connect in no time to MySQL, Postgress, MongoDB, or any other database.
                            
                            Supportive Community: PHP has a very supportive online community. The official documentation provides guides on how to use the features and you can easily get your problem fixed while stuck.</p>
