                <h1 style="color: white;">Front End Technologies in the Developer “Stack”</h1>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    The front end stack is made up of many different languages and libraries. While these vary from application to application, there are only a few generic languages understood by all web browsers. These three main front-end coding languages are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

                    Together, they create the underlying scaffolding that web browsers use to render the web pages that we interact with every day. All other libraries and front-end engineering are built upon these three main languages, which makes them must-have skills for any front-end developer.
                    
                    In fact, you can think of a webpage like a house. The initial UX design is the blueprint. HTML is the basic structure of the house. The CSS is the paint, fixtures, and other aesthetic decisions that make the house look attractive. And finally, JavaScript is the inner workings of the house (lights, heating, water) that we, the owner or renter, use and enjoy.</p>
                  <br>

                  <h1 style="color: white;">HTML</h1>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    HTML is the first layer of any website and creates the code version of a wireframe on a webpage. These wireframes exist for the styles in CSS and all the bells and whistles in JavaScript. 

                    The letters in HTML stand for Hypertext Markup Language. The markup piece of the name is the most important to remember, as markups are the proper name for HTML elements, which are also called HTML tags. HTML as a whole is the markup that creates the basic elements we view on a website. 
                    
                    However, it’s important to remember that HTML isn’t particularly intelligent. It doesn’t make decisions or capture information on its own. It simply renders the scaffolding of the web pages.</p>

                  <br>

                  <h1 style="color: white;">CSS</h1>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is what gives our HTML visual appeal and draws in the user. To put it simply, style sheets dictate the presentation of HTML elements on a page.

                    CSS is what makes everything not look like a white background with a bunch of Times New Roman texts and blue hyperlinks. Have you ever tried to load Amazon on a bad day and see nothing but a white page with a huge list of black texts, some blue links and nothing else? That’s Amazon loading without styles. Styles are what transition beautiful designs onto a site. 

                    A new trend with styling is to use what is called a CSS pre-processor. These include Less, Sass and stylists. Pre-processors are scripting languages that compile to CSS for the browser and are very popular as they expedite the development process. They accommodate some programming logic.

                    CSS pre-processors consolidate styling through “usability” and scale easily for use with large websites. Most front-end engineers of all levels have experience with pre-processors due to their power and flexibility to suit all scenarios, from building small single-page websites to enterprise applications such as Groupon or NBCUniversal.</p>

                  <br>

                  <h1 style="color: white;">JavaScript</h1>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    JavaScript is a runtime language for web browsers. This means that when you open a web page, the page will load both the foundational JavaScript that is standard with the page and any new JavaScript added to a page. The new JavaScript will load in parallel with it and can perform actions and make decisions.

                    JavaScript differentiates from back-end languages such as Java or Ruby in that it’s visible to the user and is not compiled ahead of time to run secretly behind the curtain. It’s the true programming language of front-end engineering and the underlying language that ties everything together.

                    A great example of JavaScript in action is OpenTable. Once we decide, “I want a table for two at 7 P.M. in Seattle on July 25th,” a list of restaurants with tables to reserve shows up. From here, we can look at a map with a list alongside it.</p>

                                Here’s a list of the some top frontend technologies to watch out for:
                                 <ol style="color: white;">
                               <li>HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language) <br>
                                HTML5 is a markup language used to create websites and web applications. The basic purpose of using HTML5 is to create a document that can be displayed in different browsers without any issues. HTML5 is known as the most popular front-end template or most popular front end technologies.</li>
                                
                               <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) <br>
                                This is used to style your HTML page to make it look attractive by adding colors, fonts, etc. CSS can enhance your website.</li>
                                
                               <li>JavaScript <br>
                                It allows you to add interactivity to your website by adding events like clicks, etc., so that various tasks can be performed at ease. It is a popular front end technology.</li>
                                
                               <li>React JS <br>
                                React JS is a library for building user interfaces and know as a popular front end technology. It also makes your code easier for others to understand and work with, so if you’re working with a team of developers, this tool can be helpful.
                                </li></p>

                               <li>Angular <br>
                                Another JavaScript library that lets you build dynamic websites quickly. It also has built-in support for routing (it knows how different URLs will behave based on the page they’re on). This makes building single-page applications easier! A guide on angular vs react a detailed comparison of popular frontend development tools will be helpful. It is one of the most popular front end technology.</li></p>

                               <li>Next JS <br>
                                This framework for server-rendered React applications can run in the browser or on the server. It allows developers to write ES6 code that runs in both environments without needing any transpiling.</li></p>
                            </ol>
