            <p style="color: white;">Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

                It is used for:
                
                web development (server-side),
                software development,
                mathematics,
                system scripting.Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
                Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
                Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
                Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
                Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</p>
              <br>
              <h2 style="color: white;">Pyhton History</h2>
              <p style="color: white;">Python was created by Guido van Rossum, and first released on February 20, 1991. While you may know the python as a large snake, the name of the Python programming language comes from an old BBC television comedy sketch series called Monty Python’s Flying Circus.

                One of the amazing features of Python is the fact that it is actually one person’s work. Usually, new programming languages are developed and published by large companies employing lots of professionals, and due to copyright rules, it is very hard to name any of the people involved in the project. Python is an exception.

                Of course, Guido van Rossum did not develop and evolve all the Python components himself. The speed with which Python has spread around the world is a result of the continuous work of thousands (very often anonymous) programmers, testers, users (many of them aren’t IT specialists) and enthusiasts, but it must be said that the very first idea (the seed from which Python sprouted) came to one head – Guido’s.

                Python is maintained by the Python Software Foundation, a non-profit membership organization and a community devoted to developing, improving, expanding, and popularizing the Python language and its environment.Python is omnipresent, and people use numerous Python-powered devices on a daily basis, whether they realize it or not. There are billions of lines of code written in Python, which means almost unlimited opportunities for code reuse and learning from well-crafted examples. What’s more, there is a large and very active Python community, always happy to help.

                There are also a couple of factors that make Python great for learning:
                
                It is easy to learn – the time needed to learn Python is shorter than for many other languages; this means that it’s possible to start the actual programming faster;
                It is easy to use for writing new software – it’s often possible to write code faster when using Python;
                It is easy to obtain, install and deploy – Python is free, open and multiplatform; not all languages can boast that.
                Programming skills prepare you for careers in almost any industry, and are required if you want to continue to more advanced and higher-paying software development and engineering roles. Python is the programming language that opens more doors than any other. With a solid knowledge of Python, you can work in a multitude of jobs and a multitude of industries. And the more you understand Python, the more you can do in the 21st Century. Even if you don’t need it for work, you will find it useful to know.</p>

                <h1 style="color: white;">Why python..?</h1>
                <p style="color: white;">
                  Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualisation. Since it’s relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers, such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organising finances.

                  "Writing programs is a very creative and rewarding activity," says University of Michigan and Coursera instructor Charles R Severance in his book Python for Everybody. "You can write programs for many reasons, ranging from making your living to solving a difficult data analysis problem to having fun to helping someone else solve a problem."
                  
                  What can you do with Python? Some things include:
                  
                  Data analysis and machine learning
                  
                  Web development
                  
                  Automation or scripting
                  
                  Software testing and prototyping
                  
                  Everyday tasks
                   
                </p>
                  <br>
                  <h5 style="color: white;">Data analysis and machine learning</h5>
                <p style="color: white;">Python has become a staple in data science, allowing data analysts and other professionals to use the language to conduct complex statistical calculations, create data visualisations, build machine learning algorithms, manipulate and analyse data, and complete other data-related tasks.

                  Python can build various data visualisations, like line and bar graphs, pie charts, histogrammes, and 3D plots. Python also has many libraries that enable coders to write programs for data analysis and machine learning more quickly and efficiently, like TensorFlow and Keras.</p>
                  <br>

                  <h5 style="color: white;">Web development</h5>
                  <p style="color: white;">Python is often used to develop the back end of a website or application—the parts that a user doesn’t see. Python’s role in web development includes sending data to and from servers, processing data and communicating with databases, routing URLs, and ensuring security. Python offers several frameworks for web development. Commonly used ones include Django and Flask.

                    Some web development jobs that use Python include back-end engineers, full-stack engineers, Python developers, software engineers, and DevOps engineers. </p>

                      <br>


                  <h5 style="color: white;">Automation or scripting</h5>
                  <p style="color: white;">If you perform a task repeatedly, you can work more efficiently by automating it with Python. Writing code used to build these automated processes is called scripting. In the coding world, automation can be used to check for errors across multiple files, convert files, execute simple math, and remove duplicates in data.

                    Relative beginners can even use Python to automate simple tasks on the computer—such as renaming files, finding and downloading online content, or sending emails or texts at desired intervals.</p>
                          <br>   
                  <h5 style="color: white;">Software testing and prototyping</h5>
                  <p style="color: white;">Python can aid in software development tasks like build control, bug tracking, and testing. With Python, software developers can automate testing for new products or features. Some Python tools used for software testing include Green and Requestium.</p>

                  <br>

                  <h5 style="color: white;">Everyday tasks</h5>
                  <p style="color: white;">Python isn't only for programmers and data scientists. Learning Python can open new possibilities for those in less data-heavy professions, like journalists, small business owners, or social media marketers. Python can also enable non-programmers to simplify certain tasks in their lives. Here are just a few of the tasks you could automate with Python:

                    Send yourself a text reminder to carry an umbrella anytime it’s raining
                    
                    Update your grocery shopping list
                    
                    Renaming large batches of files
                    
                    Converting text files to spreadsheets
                    
                    Randomly assign household tasks to family members
                    
                    Fill out online forms automatically</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1 style="color: white;">Why is Python so popular?</h1>
                    <p style="color: white;">
                      Python is popular for several reasons. Here's a deeper look at what makes it versatile and easy for coders to use.

                      It has a simple syntax that mimics natural language, so it’s easier to read and understand. This makes it quicker to build projects and faster to improve on them.

                      It’s versatile. Python can be used for many different tasks, from web development to machine learning.

                       It’s beginner friendly, making it popular for entry-level coders.

                      It’s open source, which means it’s free to use and distribute, even for commercial purposes.

                      Python’s archive of modules and libraries—bundles of code that third-party users have created to expand Python’s capabilities—is vast and growing.

                      Python has a large and active community that contributes to Python’s pool of modules and libraries and acts as a helpful resource for other programmers. The vast support community means that when coders need help, finding a solution is relatively easy; somebody has likely encountered the same problem before.</p>
